Finds invalid youtube videos (deleted or removed from youtube) embeded in your site.

== Description ==

Sharing (embedding) youtube videos on your site is easy but keeping them upto date is really not practical job. This plugin will help you find invalid youtube videos (Videos you have posted months or years ago but deleted/removed from youtube) and will automatically send email notifications to site admin.

Planned for Future Updates:
* bulk finding all the invalid videos at one click...
* keeping log of invalid videos in wp-admin
* allow to automatically display 'Video has been removed' like message instead of embeded video for invalid videos.
* ability to automatically replace invalid videos with new videos.
* integrating other video sharing services together with youtube.
